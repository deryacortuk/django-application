Model-View-Controller:

Model View Controller is the most commonly used design pattern. Developers find it easy to implement this design pattern.

Django MTV:

Django follows MVC pattern very closely but it uses slightly different terminology. Django is essentially an MTV (Model-Template-View) framework. Django uses the term Templates for Views and Views for Controller. In other words, in Django views are called templates and controllers are called views. Hence our HTML code will be in templates and Python code will be in views and models.
Djangoâ€™s architecture consists of three major parts:

Part 1 is a set of tools that make working with data and databases much easier
Part 2 is a plain-text templating system that can be used by non-programmers; and
Part 3 is a framework that handles communication between the user and the database and automates many of the painful parts of managing a complex website
